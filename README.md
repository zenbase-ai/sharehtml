# sharehtml

I've been using coding agents to write in markdown, make slides, and build interactive data analysis as static HTML files. Sending those files around still gets messy fast: you can't update them after sharing, and there's no way to get feedback inline. This is the reason I built sharehtml.

## What is sharehtml?

Deploy a local document, get a link where others can view it and collaborate with comments, reactions, and live presence. Re-deploy to update the content at the same URL. Markdown and common code files are converted to styled HTML automatically.

- **CLI deploys** — `sharehtml deploy report.html` → `https://sharehtml.yourteam.workers.dev/d/9brkzbe67ntm`
- **Collaborative** — comments, threaded replies, emoji reactions, text anchoring
- **Live presence** — see who's viewing and their selections
- **Home page** — your documents and recently viewed docs shared with you
- **Self-hosted** — runs on your own Cloudflare account

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+ and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (for the CLI and setup script)
- [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) with [R2 enabled](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/pricing/#free-tier) (free tier available)

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jonesphillip/sharehtml.git
cd sharehtml
pnpm install
npx wrangler login
pnpm run setup
```

The interactive setup script walks you through everything: deploying the worker, installing the CLI, and configuring authentication. Cloudflare Access is optional — the setup script asks if you want authentication. Without it, anyone with a link can view and comment.

To install the CLI directly:

```bash
# with Bun
bun install -g sharehtml

# or with npm (Bun still needs to be installed for the CLI runtime)
npm install -g sharehtml
```

If your team already has a sharehtml worker deployed, this is probably all you need — install the CLI, run `sharehtml config set-url <your-team-url>`, then `sharehtml login`.

If you enable Cloudflare Access, you'll need a [Cloudflare API token](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens) with these permissions:
- **Account > Access: Apps and Policies > Edit**
- **Account > Access: Organization, Identity Providers, and Groups > Read**

When it's done, try deploying one of the included examples:

```bash
sharehtml deploy example/coffee-report.html
# or try the markdown example:
sharehtml deploy example/sample.md
# or the interactive slideshow example:
sharehtml deploy example/nba-slideshow.html
# or deploy a code file:
sharehtml deploy apps/cli/src/index.ts
```

If a document with the same filename exists, the CLI will prompt to update it. Use `-u` to skip the prompt.

### Manual deploy

If you've already run setup and just need to redeploy:

```bash
# Deploy the worker to Cloudflare
pnpm run deploy

# Build and link the CLI globally
cd apps/cli && pnpm build && bun link
```

### Local development

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Starts the Vite dev server with Wrangler at http://localhost:5173. In dev mode, `AUTH_MODE` is `"none"` — no login required.

To use the CLI locally:

```bash
sharehtml config set-url http://localhost:5173
sharehtml deploy my-report.html
```

## Architecture

```
CLI ──► Worker ──► R2 (HTML storage)
         │
Browser ◄┘──► Durable Objects
               ├── RegistryDO (users, documents, views)
               └── DocumentDO (per-doc comments, reactions, presence via WebSocket)
```

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **[Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)** | HTTP routing, auth, serves viewer shell and home page |
| **RegistryDO** | Global [Durable Object](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/) — users, document metadata, view history (SQLite) |
| **DocumentDO** | Per-document Durable Object — comments, reactions, real-time presence over WebSocket |
| **[R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/)** | Stores the actual HTML files |
| **CLI** | Bun-based command-line tool for deploying and managing documents |

## CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `sharehtml deploy <file>` | Deploy an HTML, Markdown, or code file (creates or updates) |
| `sharehtml list` | List your documents |
| `sharehtml open <id>` | Open a document in the browser |
| `sharehtml pull <id>` | Download a document locally |
| `sharehtml delete <id>` | Delete a document |
| `sharehtml share <document>` | Make a document shareable |
| `sharehtml unshare <document>` | Make a document private |
| `sharehtml login` | Log in through Cloudflare Access |
| `sharehtml config set-url <url>` | Set the sharehtml URL |
| `sharehtml config show` | Show current configuration |

## Configuration

### Worker auth configuration

| Key | Location | Required | Description |
|-----|----------|----------|-------------|
| `AUTH_MODE` | Worker secret (`wrangler secret put`) | No | `"none"` disables auth, `"access"` enables Cloudflare Access JWT verification. Defaults to no auth if unset. |
| `ACCESS_AUD` | `apps/worker/wrangler.jsonc` (`vars`) | When `AUTH_MODE=access` | Cloudflare Access Application Audience tag (`aud`) from the Access application. |
| `ACCESS_TEAM` | `apps/worker/wrangler.jsonc` (`vars`) | When `AUTH_MODE=access` | Cloudflare Access team name. For this deployment: `zenbase`. |

### Cloudflare Zero Trust Access application (dashboard)

1. Open Cloudflare dashboard for account `Synthesis` and go to `Zero Trust` -> `Access` -> `Applications`.
2. Create (or edit) the self-hosted application for the sharehtml worker URL (`https://sharehtml.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`).
3. Configure an allow policy using `Emails ending in` and set it to `zenbase.ai`.
4. Save the application, then copy its `Application Audience Tag` (`aud`).
5. Update `apps/worker/wrangler.jsonc` and replace `REPLACE_WITH_ACCESS_APPLICATION_AUDIENCE_TAG` in `vars.ACCESS_AUD`.
6. Set auth mode to access:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put AUTH_MODE
# value: access
```
